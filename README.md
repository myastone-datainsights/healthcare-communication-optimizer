🏥 Transform complex clinical discharge instructions into patient-friendly language using MedGemma AI

Built for the [MedGemma Impact Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/med-gemma-impact-challenge)

## The Problem

Healthcare literacy gaps cost 236 billion dollars annually. Patients receive discharge instructions in clinical language they don't understand, leading to medication errors, preventable readmissions, and poor health outcomes.

Example: "Administer 500mg acetaminophen PO q6h PRN for pain. Monitor for hepatotoxicity."

Most patients don't know: PO = by mouth, q6h = every 6 hours, PRN = as needed, hepatotoxicity = liver damage

## The Solution

MedGemma-powered automatic transformation into audience-appropriate versions:
- Patient-level (6-8th grade): Clear, supportive language
- Caregiver-level (9-12th grade): Practical guidance
- Community-level: General public education

## Technology Stack

- MedGemma - Google Health AI
- Python 3.10+
- Streamlit - Interactive interface
- Transformers - Model inference
